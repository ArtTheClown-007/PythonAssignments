    "Q1. Explain the key features of python that make it a popular choice for programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Python is beginner friendly and has a readable syntax. It has a \n",
    "vast library that save developers precious time. It has a strong community and \n",
    "an object-oriented approach for programming which saves time and makes programming easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Predefined keywords in Python are reserved for their specific function and cannot be used as identifiers.\n",
    "These keywords define the code and are the building blocks of a program written in Python.\n",
    "For example: the 'print' keyword outputs string on the screen, 'for','while' keywords are used for looping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Mutable objects can be altered while immutable objects cannot be altered or\n",
    "changed once declared. For example, a character in a string cannot be assigned to another\n",
    "character, similarly an element of a set cannot be changed to another.In case of mutable objects like\n",
    "a list, the elements can be changed after declaration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Discuss the different types of operators in Python and provide examples of how they are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The following are the types of operators in Python and their usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arithmetic Operators:\n",
    "The operators that perform basic mathematical operations.\n",
    "For Example:\n",
    "           + (Addition): 5 + 3 equals 8.\n",
    "           - (Subtraction): 4 - 1 equals 3.\n",
    "           * (Multiplication): 2 * 3 equals 6.\n",
    "           / (Division): 4 / 2 equals 2.\n",
    "           // (Floor Division): 10 // 3 equals 3.\n",
    "           % (Modulo): 5 % 2 equals 1.\n",
    "           ** (Power): 4 ** 2 equals 16.\n",
    "           \n",
    "2. Assignment Operators:\n",
    "The operators that assign values to variables.\n",
    "For Example:\n",
    "           = (Assignment): y = 5 assigns 5 to y.\n",
    "           += (Addition Assignment): a += 1 is same as a = a + 1.\n",
    "           -= (Subtraction Assignment): a -= 3 is same as a = a - 3.\n",
    "           *= (Multiplication Assignment): a *= 4 is same as a = a * 4.\n",
    "           /= (Division Assignment): a /= 3 is same as a = a / 3.\n",
    "           \n",
    "3. Comparison Operators:\n",
    "The operators that compare two values and return a boolean result (True or False).\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "           == (Equal To): 3 == 5 returns False.\n",
    "           != (Not Equal To): 3 != 5 returns True.\n",
    "           > (Greater Than): 3 > 5 returns False.\n",
    "           < (Less Than): 3 < 5 returns True.\n",
    "           >= (Greater Than or Equal To): 3 >= 5 returns False.\n",
    "           <= (Less Than or Equal To): 3 <= 5 returns True.\n",
    "           \n",
    "4. Logical Operators:\n",
    "The operators that combine boolean values.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "and: True and False results in False.\n",
    "or: True or False results in True.\n",
    "not: not True results in False.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Bitwise Operators:\n",
    "The operators that perform bit-level operations.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "& (Bitwise AND): 5 & 3 returns 1.\n",
    "| (Bitwise OR): 5 | 3 returns 7.\n",
    "^ (Bitwise XOR): 5 ^ 3 returns 6.\n",
    "~ (Bitwise NOT): ~ 10 returns -11.\n",
    "<<(Left Shift): Adds zeros at the end of the binary equivalent of the number operated on.\n",
    ">>(Right Shift): Removes binary numbers from the end of the binary equivalent of the \n",
    "number operated on.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Identity Operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "is and is not: These are used for identity comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Membership Operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "in and not in: These are used to check if a value exists in objects like list or string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: There are two types of casts namely , implicit and explicit. Implicit cast \n",
    "is done by Python itself when a float and an int type data is added wherein int is\n",
    "promoted to float. Explicit cast on the other hand is performed by the programmer, \n",
    "when one converts a numerical string, for example '10000' to an int type using int('10000') command.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6 How do conditional statements work in Python? Illustrate with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Conditional statements in Python are used to execute different code blocks based on certain conditions. \n",
    "The most common conditional statements in Python are if, elif (abbreviation for \"else if\"), and else.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. if statement: \n",
    "\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed if the condition is True\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "isAlive = true\n",
    "\n",
    "if isAlive:\n",
    "    print('can eat')\n",
    "    print('can write code')\n",
    "    print('can sleep')\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, as isAlive is true the code block is executed and the text is \n",
    "printed on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. if-else statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed if the condition is True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed if the condition is False\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Score = 89\n",
    "\n",
    "if Score > 90:\n",
    "    print('Excellent Score :)')\n",
    "    \n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('Better luck next time :(')\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, as Score is less than 90 the else block is executed and the corresponding\n",
    "text is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. if-elif-else statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed if condition1 is True\n",
    "elif condition2:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed if condition2 is True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # code block to be executed if all conditions are False\n",

    "    print(\"x is negative\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is zero\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, as x is 0 the else block is executed and the corresponding\n",
    "text is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Describe the different types of loops in Python and their use cases with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In Python, there are several types of loops that are commonly used to iterate over sequences or execute a block of code repeatedly. \n",
    "The main types of loops in Python are for loop, while loop, and nested loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. for loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, tuple, string, or range.\n",
    "\n",
    "colors = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]\n",
    "for color in colors:\n",
    "    print(color)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. while loop:\n",
    "The while loop is used to execute a block of code as long as a specific condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "count = 10\n",
    "while count > 0:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count -= 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Prints 10,9,8,7,6....1 on the screen on discrete lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Nested loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested loops are loops within loops. \n",
    "They are used to iterate over multiple sequences or to perform repeated operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "Printing a square on the screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(4):\n",
    "    for j in range(4):\n",
    "        print('*')\n",
    "    print( )\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it is a 3 x 3 square.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Break and continue statements: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. break keyword is used to break out of a loop.\n",
    "2. continue keyword is used to skip the current iteration and start from \n",
    "   the beginning of the loop.\n",
    "\n"
